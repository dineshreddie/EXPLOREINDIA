     <p>According to legend in Tretayugam, there was a sage called Yadarishi, who was son of the great sage Rishyasrunga and Santa Devi and performed penance inside a cave with Anjaneya's blessings. Pleased with his devotion Lord Narasimha reportedly appeared before him in five different forms namely Sri Jwala Narasimha , SriGandabherunda, Sri Yogananda, Sri Ugra and Sri Lakshminarasimha which later manifested into finely sculpted forms and hence it is worshiped as Pancha Narasimha Kshetram. According to Skanda Purana, there is a cave temple of Lord Vishnu where several years ago the invincible Sudharshna chakra moved in the direction like a compass guiding them towards this temple. Here Aaradhana and Puja are performed as per Pancharatra Agamam. The puja vidhanam here is done as prescribed by Late Sri Vangeepuram Narasimhacharyulu who had served as Sthanacharya of this famous temple. In 15th Century, the Vijayanagara king Sri Krishnadevarayalu had mentioned about the temple in autobiography that before going to war he always visited the temple praying the lord for victory. The temple town has facilities for accommodation of pilgrims while many tonsure their heads after fulfillment of a wish. The town is well connected by a ghat road to the capital and nearby key towns.
